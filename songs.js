    lyric: `He's laughing with another girl
    And playing with another heart
    Placing high stakes, making hearts ache
    He's loved in seven languages
    Jukebox life, diamond nights and ruby lights, high in the sky
    Heaven help him, when he falls
    Diamond life, lover boy
    He moves in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
    City lights, business nights
    When you require streetcar desire for higher heights
    No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
    When sentiment is left to chance
    No place to be ending but somewhere to start
    No need to ask, he's a smooth operator
    Smooth operator
    Smooth operator
    Smooth operator
    Coast to coast, LA to Chicago
    Western male
    Across the north and south to Key Largo
    Love for sale
    Face to face, each classic case
    We shadow box and double cross, yet need the chase
    A license to love, insurance to hold
    Melts all your memories and change into gold
    His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold
    No need to ask, he's a smooth operator
    Smooth operator
    Smooth operator
    Smooth operator
    Coast to coast, LA to Chicago
    Western male
    Across the north and south to Key Largo
    Love for sale`
